This Regulation is intended to contribute to the accomplishment of \nan area of freedom, security and justice and of an economic union, to economic and social progress, to the \nstrengthening and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and to the well-being of natural \npersons. \n(3)  \nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) seeks to harmonise the protection of \nfundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of processing activities and to ensure the free flow \nof personal data between Member States. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/1 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) OJ C 229, 31.7.2012, p. 90. \n(2) OJ C 391, 18.12.2012, p. 127. \n(3) Position of the European Parliament of 12 March 2014 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and position of the Council at first \nreading of 8 April 2016 (not yet published in the Official Journal). Position of the European Parliament of 14 April 2016. \n(4) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to \nthe processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31). \n(4)  \nThe processing of personal data should be designed to serve mankind. The right to the protection of personal \ndata is not an absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced against \nother fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This Regulation respects all \nfundamental rights and observes the freedoms and principles recognised in the Charter as enshrined in the \nTreaties, in particular the respect for private and family life, home and communications, the protection of \npersonal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom to \nconduct a business, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, and cultural, religious and linguistic \ndiversity. \n(5)  \nThe economic and social integration resulting from the functioning of the internal market has led to a substantial \nincrease in cross-border flows of personal data. The exchange of personal data between public and private actors, \nincluding natural persons, associations and undertakings across the Union has increased. National authorities in \nthe Member States are being called upon by Union law to cooperate and exchange personal data so as to be able \nto perform their duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another Member State. \n(6)  \nRapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges for the protection of personal \ndata. The scale of the collection and sharing of personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both \nprivate companies and public authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented scale in order to \npursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly make personal information available publicly and globally. \nTechnology has transformed both the economy and social life, and should further facilitate the free flow of \npersonal data within the Union and the transfer to third countries and international organisations, while ensuring \na high level of the protection of personal data. \n(7)  \nThose developments require a strong and more coherent data protection framework in the Union, backed by \nstrong enforcement, given the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy to develop \nacross the internal market. Natural persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal and practical \ncertainty for natural persons, economic operators and public authorities should be enhanced. \n(8)  \nWhere this Regulation provides for specifications or restrictions of its rules by Member State law, Member States \nmay, as far as necessary for coherence and for making the national provisions comprehensible to the persons to \nwhom they apply, incorporate elements of this Regulation into their national law. \n(9)  \nThe objectives and principles of Directive 95/46/EC remain sound, but it has not prevented fragmentation in the \nimplementation of data protection across the Union, legal uncertainty or a widespread public perception that \nthere are significant risks to the protection of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. \nDifferences in the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular the right to the \nprotection of personal data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the Member States may prevent the \nfree flow of personal data throughout the Union. Those differences may therefore constitute an obstacle to the \npursuit of economic activities at the level of the Union, distort competition and impede authorities in the \ndischarge of their responsibilities under Union law. Such a difference in levels of protection is due to the \nexistence of differences in the implementation and application of Directive 95/46/EC. \n(10)  \nIn order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons and to remove the obstacles to \nflows of personal data within the Union, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons \nwith regard to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. Consistent and \nhomogenous application of the rules for the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural \npersons with regard to the processing of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. Regarding the \nprocessing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in \nthe public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should be \nallowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the application of the rules of this \nRegulation. In conjunction with the general and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive \n95/46/EC, Member States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. This \nRegulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify its rules, including for the \nprocessing of special categories of personal data (\u2018sensitive data\u2019). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude \nMember State law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including determining more \nprecisely the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/2 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(11)  \nEffective protection of personal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening and setting out in detail of \nthe rights of data subjects and the obligations of those who process and determine the processing of personal \ndata, as well as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for the protection of \npersonal data and equivalent sanctions for infringements in the Member States. \n(12)  \nArticle 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay down the rules relating to the \nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free \nmovement of personal data. \n(13)  \nIn order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent \ndivergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary \nto provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized \nenterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights \nand obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the \nprocessing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation \nbetween the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market \nrequires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons \nconnected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account \nof the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for \norganisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions \nand bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific \nneeds of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation \n2003/361/EC (1). \n(14)  \nThe protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of \nresidence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of \npersonal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including \nthe name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person. \n(15)\nIn order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection of natural persons should be technolo\u00ad\ngically neutral and should not depend on the techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to \nthe processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing, if the personal data are \ncontained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages, \nwhich are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within the scope of this Regulation. \n(16)  \nThis Regulation does not apply to issues of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms or the free flow of \npersonal data related to activities which fall outside the scope of Union law, such as activities concerning national \nsecurity. This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying \nout activities in relation to the common foreign and security policy of the Union. \n(17)  \nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) applies to the processing of \npersonal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other \nUnion legal acts applicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the principles and rules \nestablished in this Regulation and applied in the light of this Regulation. In order to provide a strong and \ncoherent data protection framework in the Union, the necessary adaptations of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 \nshould follow after the adoption of this Regulation, in order to allow application at the same time as this \nRegulation. \n(18)  \nThis Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely \npersonal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/3 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium\u2011sized enterprises (C(2003) 1422) \n(OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36). \n(2) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with \nregard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, \n12.1.2001, p. 1). \nhousehold activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online \nactivity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or \nprocessors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities. \n(19)  \nThe protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the \npurposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of \ncriminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security and the free \nmovement of such data, is the subject of a specific Union legal act. This Regulation should not, therefore, apply \nto processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this \nRegulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely \nDirective (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1). Member States may entrust \ncompetent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily \ncarried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the \nexecution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so \nthat the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, \nfalls within the scope of this Regulation. \nWith regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope \nof this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the \napplication of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements \nfor the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account \nthe constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the \nprocessing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should \nprovide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and \nrights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to \nsafeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or \nprosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the \nprevention of threats to public security. This is relevant for instance in the framework of anti-money laundering \nor the activities of forensic laboratories. \n(20)  \nWhile this Regulation applies, inter alia, to the activities of courts and other judicial authorities, Union or \nMember State law could specify the processing operations and processing procedures in relation to the \nprocessing of personal data by courts and other judicial authorities. The competence of the supervisory \nauthorities should not cover the processing of personal data when courts are acting in their judicial capacity, in \norder to safeguard the independence of the judiciary in the performance of its judicial tasks, including decision- \nmaking. It should be possible to entrust supervision of such data processing operations to specific bodies within \nthe judicial system of the Member State, which should, in particular ensure compliance with the rules of this \nRegulation, enhance awareness among members of the judiciary of their obligations under this Regulation and \nhandle complaints in relation to such data processing operations. \n(21)  \nThis Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and \nof the Council (2), in particular of the liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12 to 15 of that \nDirective. That Directive seeks to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market by ensuring the free \nmovement of information society services between Member States. \n(22)  \nAny processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor \nin the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself \ntakes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable \narrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal \npersonality, is not the determining factor in that respect. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/4 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with \nregard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or \nprosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data and repealing Council \nFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA (see page 89 of this Official Journal). \n(2) Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society \nservices, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (\u2018Directive on electronic commerce\u2019) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1). \n(23)  \nIn order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this \nRegulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor \nnot established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to \noffering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to \ndetermine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the \nUnion, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services \nto data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, \nprocessor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use \nof a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain \nsuch intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States \nwith the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or \nusers who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data \nsubjects in the Union. \n(24)  \nThe processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not \nestablished in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the \nbehaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine \nwhether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be \nascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal \ndata processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions \nconcerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. \n(25)  \nWhere Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a \ncontroller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post. \n(26)  \nThe principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural \nperson. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by \nthe use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To \ndetermine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to \nbe used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly \nor indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account \nshould be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, \ntaking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. \nThe principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information \nwhich does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in \nsuch a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern \nthe processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. \n(27)  \nThis Regulation does not apply to the personal data of deceased persons. Member States may provide for rules \nregarding the processing of personal data of deceased persons. \n(28)  \nThe application of pseudonymisation to personal data can reduce the risks to the data subjects concerned and \nhelp controllers and processors to meet their data-protection obligations. The explicit introduction of \u2018pseudony\u00ad\nmisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. \n(29)\nIn order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymi\u00ad\nsation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has \ntaken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this \nRegulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data \nsubject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons \nwithin the same controller. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/5 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(30)  \nNatural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and \nprotocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency \nidentification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other \ninformation received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them. \n(31)  \nPublic authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a legal obligation for the exercise of \ntheir official mission, such as tax and customs authorities, financial investigation units, independent adminis\u00ad\ntrative authorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation and supervision of securities \nmarkets should not be regarded as recipients if they receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a \nparticular inquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law. The requests for \ndisclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in writing, reasoned and occasional and should not \nconcern the entirety of a filing system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing of personal \ndata by those public authorities should comply with the applicable data-protection rules according to the \npurposes of the processing. \n(32)  \nConsent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and \nunambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, \nsuch as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a \nbox when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another \nstatement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed \nprocessing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute \nconsent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the \nprocessing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be \ngiven following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive \nto the use of the service for which it is provided. \n(33)  \nIt is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at \nthe time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of \nscientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should \nhave the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the \nextent allowed by the intended purpose. \n(34)  \nGenetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a \nnatural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in \nparticular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of \nanother element enabling equivalent information to be obtained. \n(35)  \nPersonal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which \nreveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This \nincludes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of, \nhealth care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) to \nthat natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural \nperson for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily \nsubstance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, \ndisability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data \nsubject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical \ndevice or an in vitro diagnostic test. \n(36)  \nThe main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the \nUnion, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another \nestablishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/6 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in \ncross\u2011border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45). \nthe main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to \nobjective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main \ndecisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not \ndepend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of \ntechnical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, \nconstitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main \nestablishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no \ncentral administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In \ncases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain \nthe supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the \nsupervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that \nsupervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any \ncase, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more \nestablishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision \nconcerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main \nestablishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of \nundertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking. \n(37)  \nA group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the \ncontrolling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other \nundertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the \npower to have personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of \npersonal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of \nundertakings. \n(38)  \nChildren merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, as they may be less aware of the risks, \nconsequences and safeguards concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal data. Such \nspecific protection should, in particular, apply to the use of personal data of children for the purposes of \nmarketing or creating personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children \nwhen using services offered directly to a child. The consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be \nnecessary in the context of preventive or counselling services offered directly to a child. \n(39)  \nAny processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that \npersonal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the \npersonal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communi\u00ad\ncation relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear \nand plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the \nidentity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and \ntransparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and \ncommunication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made \naware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their \nrights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed \nshould be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal \ndata should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. \nThis requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict \nminimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be \nfulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits \nshould be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken \nto ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a \nmanner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing \nunauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. \n(40)  \nIn order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data \nsubject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/7 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nMember State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal \nobligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data \nsubject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. \n(41)  \nWhere this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative \nact adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the \nMember State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its \napplication should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice \nof the European Union (the \u2018Court of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights. \n(42)  \nWhere processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the \ndata subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration \non another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to \nwhich consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC (1) a declaration of consent pre- \nformulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain \nlanguage and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at \nleast of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are \nintended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is \nunable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. \n(43)  \nIn order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing \nof personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in \nparticular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in \nall the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow \nseparate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the \nindividual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the \nconsent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance. \n(44)  \nProcessing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a \ncontract. \n(45)  \nWhere processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where \nprocessing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of \nofficial authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not \nrequire a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a \nlegal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task \ncarried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for \nUnion or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the \ngeneral conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications \nfor determining the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects \nconcerned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period \nand other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to \ndetermine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official \nauthority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is \nin the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the \nmanagement of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association. \n(46)  \nThe processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest \nwhich is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/8 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, p. 29). \nbased on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing \ncannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds \nof public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for \nhumanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian \nemergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters. \n(47)  \nThe legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be \ndisclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the \nfundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable \nexpectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist \nfor example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in \nsituations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of \na legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the \ntime and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. \nThe interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data \ncontroller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect \nfurther processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to \nprocess personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the \nperformance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing \nfraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for \ndirect marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest. \n(48)  \nControllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a \nlegitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative \npurposes, including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer \nof personal data, within a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected. \n(49)  \nThe processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring \nnetwork and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level \nof confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, \nintegrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered \nby, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams \n(CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications \nnetworks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of \nthe data controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic \ncommunications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage to \ncomputer and electronic communication systems. \n(50)  \nThe processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected \nshould be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were \ninitially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal \ndata is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or \nin the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and \nspecify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. \nFurther processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or \nstatistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided \nby Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further \nprocessing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for \nwhich the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the \nlawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and \nthe purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in \nparticular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/9 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nfurther use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data \nsubjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing \noperations. \nWhere the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which \nconstitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important \nobjectives of general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data \nirrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this \nRegulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights \nincluding the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by \nthe controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the \nsame criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the \nlegitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the \ncontroller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a \nlegal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy. \n(51)  \nPersonal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms \nmerit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights \nand freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use \nof the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which \nattempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systemati\u00ad\ncally be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of \nbiometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or \nauthentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in \nspecific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific \nprovisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance \nwith a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of \nofficial authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general \nprinciples and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful \nprocessing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data \nshould be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of \nspecific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain \nassociations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms. \n(52)  \nDerogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when \nprovided for in Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and \nother fundamental rights, where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the \nfield of employment law, social protection law including pensions and for health security, monitoring and alert \npurposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a \nderogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care \nservices, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims \nfor benefits and services in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific \nor historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such \npersonal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court \nproceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. \n(53)  \nSpecial categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes \nonly where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in \nparticular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing \nby the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, \nmanagement information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and \nensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert \npurposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical \npurposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for \nstudies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for \nharmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of \nspecific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/10 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nby persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should provide for \nspecific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons. \nMember States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard \nto the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the \nfree flow of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data. \n(54)  \nThe processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas \nof public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific \nmeasures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should be \ninterpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), \nnamely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants \nhaving an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and \nuniversal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such \nprocessing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being \nprocessed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies. \n(55)  \nMoreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid down \nby constitutional law or by international public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out \non grounds of public interest. \n(56)  \nWhere in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires \nthat political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be \npermitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established. \n(57)  \nIf the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data \ncontroller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the \nsole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to \ntake additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. \nIdentification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication \nmechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log-in to the on-line service offered by the \ndata controller. \n(58)  \nThe principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be \nconcise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where \nappropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when \naddressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of \nactors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand \nwhether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the \ncase of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, \nwhere processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily \nunderstand. \n(59)  \nModalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation, \nincluding mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification \nor erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for \nrequests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The \ncontroller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest \nwithin one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/11 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on Community statistics on public \nhealth and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70). \n(60)  \nThe principles of fair and transparent processing require that the data subject be informed of the existence of the \nprocessing operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the data subject with any further \ninformation necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing taking into account the specific circumstances \nand context in which the personal data are processed. Furthermore, the data subject should be informed of the \nexistence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where the personal data are collected from the \ndata subject, the data subject should also be informed whether he or she is obliged to provide the personal data \nand of the consequences, where he or she does not provide such data. That information may be provided in \ncombination with standardised icons in order to give in an easily visible, intelligible and clearly legible manner, a \nmeaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be \nmachine-readable. \n(61)  \nThe information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him \nor her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another \nsource, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be \nlegitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first \ndisclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that \nfor which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with \ninformation on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data \ncannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be \nprovided. \n(62)  \nHowever, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide information where the data subject already \npossesses the information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is expressly laid down by law \nor where the provision of information to the data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a dispropor\u00ad\ntionate effort. The latter could in particular be the case where processing is carried out for archiving purposes in \nthe public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. In that regard, the number of \ndata subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into consideration. \n(63)  \nA data subject should have the right of access to personal data which have been collected concerning him or her, \nand to exercise that right easily and at reasonable intervals, in order to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of \nthe processing. This includes the right for data subjects to have access to data concerning their health, for \nexample the data in their medical records containing information such as diagnoses, examination results, \nassessments by treating physicians and any treatment or interventions provided. Every data subject should \ntherefore have the right to know and obtain communication in particular with regard to the purposes for which \nthe personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the personal data are processed, the \nrecipients of the personal data, the logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least when \nbased on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where possible, the controller should be able to provide \nremote access to a secure system which would provide the data subject with direct access to his or her personal \ndata. That right should not adversely affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or intellectual \nproperty and in particular the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations \nshould not be a refusal to provide all information to the data subject. Where the controller processes a large \nquantity of information concerning the data subject, the controller should be able to request that, before the \ninformation is delivered, the data subject specify the information or processing activities to which the request \nrelates. \n(64)  \nThe controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in \nparticular in the context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should not retain personal data for \nthe sole purpose of being able to react to potential requests. \n(65)  \nA data subject should have the right to have personal data concerning him or her rectified and a \u2018right to be \nforgotten\u2019 where the retention of such data infringes this Regulation or Union or Member State law to which the \ncontroller is subject. In particular, a data subject should have the right to have his or her personal data erased \nand no longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which \nthey are collected or otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn his or her consent or objects to \nthe processing of personal data concerning him or her, or where the processing of his or her personal data does \nnot otherwise comply with this Regulation. That right is relevant in particular where the data subject has given \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/12 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nhis or her consent as a child and is not fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to \nremove such personal data, especially on the internet. The data subject should be able to exercise that right \nnotwithstanding the fact that he or she is no longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal data \nshould be lawful where it is necessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for \ncompliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the \nexercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public \nhealth, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical \npurposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. \n(66)  \nTo strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in \nsuch a way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be obliged to inform the controllers \nwhich are processing such personal data to erase any links to, or copies or replications of those personal data. In \ndoing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into account available technology and the means \navailable to the controller, including technical measures, to inform the controllers which are processing the \npersonal data of the data subject's request. \n(67)  \nMethods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could include, inter alia, temporarily moving the \nselected data to another processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable to users, or temporarily \nremoving published data from a website. In automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in \nprinciple be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the personal data are not subject to further \nprocessing operations and cannot be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted should \nbe clearly indicated in the system. \n(68)  \nTo further strengthen the control over his or her own data, where the processing of personal data is carried out \nby automated means, the data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data concerning him or her \nwhich he or she has provided to a controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable \nformat, and to transmit it to another controller. Data controllers should be encouraged to develop interoperable \nformats that enable data portability. That right should apply where the data subject provided the personal data on \nthe basis of his or her consent or the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not \napply where processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. By its very nature, that right \nshould not be exercised against controllers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It \nshould therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal \nobligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or \nin the exercise of an official authority vested in the controller. The data subject's right to transmit or receive \npersonal data concerning him or her should not create an obligation for the controllers to adopt or maintain \nprocessing systems which are technically compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one \ndata subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal data should be without prejudice to the rights and \nfreedoms of other data subjects in accordance with this Regulation. Furthermore, that right should not prejudice \nthe right of the data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the limitations of that right as set out in \nthis Regulation and should, in particular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the data subject \nwhich have been provided by him or her for the performance of a contract to the extent that and for as long as \nthe personal data are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically feasible, the data subject \nshould have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another. \n(69)  \nWhere personal data might lawfully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance of a task \ncarried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, or on grounds of \nthe legitimate interests of a controller or a third party, a data subject should, nevertheless, be entitled to object to \nthe processing of any personal data relating to his or her particular situation. It should be for the controller to \ndemonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms \nof the data subject. \n(70)  \nWhere personal data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject should have the right to \nobject to such processing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether \nwith regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That right should be explicitly brought \nto the attention of the data subject and presented clearly and separately from any other information. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/13 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(71)  \nThe data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating \npersonal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing and which produces legal \neffects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, such as automatic refusal of an online \ncredit application or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such processing includes \u2018profiling\u2019 \nthat consists of any form of automated processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a \nnatural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning the data subject's performance at work, \neconomic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location or movements, \nwhere it produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. However, \ndecision-making based on such processing, including profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorised by \nUnion or Member State law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud and tax-evasion monitoring \nand prevention purposes conducted in accordance with the regulations, standards and recommendations of \nUnion institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security and reliability of a service provided by \nthe controller, or necessary for the entering or performance of a contract between the data subject and a \ncontroller, or when the data subject has given his or her explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be \nsubject to suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the data subject and the right to \nobtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached \nafter such assessment and to challenge the decision. Such measure should not concern a child. \nIn order to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account the specific \ncircumstances and context in which the personal data are processed, the controller should use appropriate \nmathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures \nappropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and \nthe risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks \ninvolved for the interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents, inter alia, discriminatory effects on \nnatural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, religion or beliefs, trade union \nmembership, genetic or health status or sexual orientation, or that result in measures having such an effect. \nAutomated decision-making and profiling based on special categories of personal data should be allowed only \nunder specific conditions. \n(72)  \nProfiling is subject to the rules of this Regulation governing the processing of personal data, such as the legal \ngrounds for processing or data protection principles. The European Data Protection Board established by this \nRegulation (the \u2018Board\u2019) should be able to issue guidance in that context. \n(73)  \nRestrictions concerning specific principles and the rights of information, access to and rectification or erasure of \npersonal data, the right to data portability, the right to object, decisions based on profiling, as well as the \ncommunication of a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations of the controllers may \nbe imposed by Union or Member State law, as far as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to \nsafeguard public security, including the protection of human life especially in response to natural or manmade \ndisasters, the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal \npenalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, or of breaches of \nethics for regulated professions, other important objectives of general public interest of the Union or of a \nMember State, in particular an important economic or financial interest of the Union or of a Member State, the \nkeeping of public registers kept for reasons of general public interest, further processing of archived personal data \nto provide specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes or the \nprotection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, including social protection, public health and \nhumanitarian purposes. Those restrictions should be in accordance with the requirements set out in the Charter \nand in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. \n(74)  \nThe responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of personal data carried out by the controller \nor on the controller's behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to implement \nappropriate and effective measures and be able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with this \nRegulation, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those measures should take into account the nature, \nscope, context and purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/14 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(75)  \nThe risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood and severity, may result from \npersonal data processing which could lead to physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the \nprocessing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of \nconfidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, or \nany other significant economic or social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and \nfreedoms or prevented from exercising control over their personal data; where personal data are processed which \nreveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and \nthe processing of genetic data, data concerning health or data concerning sex life or criminal convictions and \noffences or related security measures; where personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing or predicting \naspects concerning performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability \nor behaviour, location or movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; where personal data of \nvulnerable natural persons, in particular of children, are processed; or where processing involves a large amount \nof personal data and affects a large number of data subjects. \n(76)  \nThe likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject should be determined by \nreference to the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. Risk should be evaluated on the basis of \nan objective assessment, by which it is established whether data processing operations involve a risk or a high \nrisk. \n(77)  \nGuidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the \ncontroller or the processor, especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing, their \nassessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the identification of best practices to mitigate \nthe risk, could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, \nguidelines provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer. The Board may also issue \nguidelines on processing operations that are considered to be unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and \nfreedoms of natural persons and indicate what measures may be sufficient in such cases to address such risk. \n(78)  \nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data \nrequire that appropriate technical and organisational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of this \nRegulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller should \nadopt internal policies and implement measures which meet in particular the principles of data protection by \ndesign and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of minimising the processing of \npersonal data, pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible, transparency with regard to the functions and \nprocessing of personal data, enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing, enabling the controller to \ncreate and improve security features. When developing, designing, selecting and using applications, services and \nproducts that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal data to fulfil their task, producers \nof the products, services and applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to data protection \nwhen developing and designing such products, services and applications and, with due regard to the state of the \nart, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfil their data protection obligations. The principles \nof data protection by design and by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of public \ntenders. \n(79)  \nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the responsibility and liability of controllers \nand processors, also in relation to the monitoring by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear \nallocation of the responsibilities under this Regulation, including where a controller determines the purposes and \nmeans of the processing jointly with other controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of \na controller. \n(80)  \nWhere a controller or a processor not established in the Union is processing personal data of data subjects who \nare in the Union whose processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services, irrespective of \nwhether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union, or to the monitoring of \ntheir behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union, the controller or the processor should \ndesignate a representative, unless the processing is occasional, does not include processing, on a large scale, of \nspecial categories of personal data or the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and \noffences, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/15 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nnature, context, scope and purposes of the processing or if the controller is a public authority or body. The rep\u00ad\nresentative should act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed by any supervisory \nauthority. The representative should be explicitly designated by a written mandate of the controller or of the \nprocessor to act on its behalf with regard to its obligations under this Regulation. The designation of such a rep\u00ad\nresentative does not affect the responsibility or liability of the controller or of the processor under this \nRegulation. Such a representative should perform its tasks according to the mandate received from the controller \nor processor, including cooperating with the competent supervisory authorities with regard to any action taken \nto ensure compliance with this Regulation. The designated representative should be subject to enforcement \nproceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or processor. \n(81)  \nTo ensure compliance with the requirements of this Regulation in respect of the processing to be carried out by \nthe processor on behalf of the controller, when entrusting a processor with processing activities, the controller \nshould use only processors providing sufficient guarantees, in particular in terms of expert knowledge, reliability \nand resources, to implement technical and organisational measures which will meet the requirements of this \nRegulation, including for the security of processing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of \nconduct or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the \nobligations of the controller. The carrying-out of processing by a processor should be governed by a contract or \nother legal act under Union or Member State law, binding the processor to the controller, setting out the subject- \nmatter and duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the processing, the type of personal data and \ncategories of data subjects, taking into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the processor in the \ncontext of the processing to be carried out and the risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. The \ncontroller and processor may choose to use an individual contract or standard contractual clauses which are \nadopted either directly by the Commission or by a supervisory authority in accordance with the consistency \nmechanism and then adopted by the Commission. After the completion of the processing on behalf of the \ncontroller, the processor should, at the choice of the controller, return or delete the personal data, unless there is \na requirement to store the personal data under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject. \n(82)  \nIn order to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation, the controller or processor should maintain records of \nprocessing activities under its responsibility. Each controller and processor should be obliged to cooperate with \nthe supervisory authority and make those records, on request, available to it, so that it might serve for \nmonitoring those processing operations. \n(83)  \nIn order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or \nprocessor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, \nsuch as encryption. Those measures should ensure an appropriate level of security, including confidentiality, \ntaking into account the state of the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the nature of \nthe personal data to be protected. In assessing data security risk, consideration should be given to the risks that \nare presented by personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, \nunauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed which may in \nparticular lead to physical, material or non-material damage. \n(84)  \nIn order to enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely to result in a high \nrisk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a \ndata protection impact assessment to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of that \nrisk. The outcome of the assessment should be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to \nbe taken in order to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies with this Regulation. Where a \ndata-protection impact assessment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk which the controller \ncannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and costs of implementation, a \nconsultation of the supervisory authority should take place prior to the processing. \n(85)  \nA personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or \nnon-material damage to natural persons such as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their \nrights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation, damage \nto reputation, loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant \neconomic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/16 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \naware that a personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify the personal data breach to the \nsupervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become \naware of it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the accountability principle, that the \npersonal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where such \nnotification cannot be achieved within 72 hours, the reasons for the delay should accompany the notification \nand information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. \n(86)  \nThe controller should communicate to the data subject a personal data breach, without undue delay, where that \npersonal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural person in order to \nallow him or her to take the necessary precautions. The communication should describe the nature of the \npersonal data breach as well as recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential adverse \neffects. Such communications to data subjects should be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close \ncooperation with the supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by it or by other relevant authorities \nsuch as law-enforcement authorities. For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call \nfor prompt communication with data subjects whereas the need to implement appropriate measures against \ncontinuing or similar personal data breaches may justify more time for communication. \n(87)  \nIt should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protection and organisational measures have been \nimplemented to establish immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to inform promptly \nthe supervisory authority and the data subject. The fact that the notification was made without undue delay \nshould be established taking into account in particular the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its \nconsequences and adverse effects for the data subject. Such notification may result in an intervention of the \nsupervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in this Regulation. \n(88)  \nIn setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable to the notification of personal data \nbreaches, due consideration should be given to the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not \npersonal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection measures, effectively limiting the likelihood \nof identity fraud or other forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into account the \nlegitimate interests of law-enforcement authorities where early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investi\u00ad\ngation of the circumstances of a personal data breach. \n(89)  \nDirective 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation to notify the processing of personal data to the supervisory \nauthorities. While that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute \nto improving the protection of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should \ntherefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types \nof processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by \nvirtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be those which in, \nparticular, involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment \nhas been carried out before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has \nelapsed since the initial processing. \n(90)  \nIn such cases, a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing \nin order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, \ncontext and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk. That impact assessment should include, in \nparticular, the measures, safeguards and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk, ensuring the protection of \npersonal data and demonstrating compliance with this Regulation. \n(91)  \nThis should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations which aim to process a considerable amount \nof personal data at regional, national or supranational level and which could affect a large number of data \nsubjects and which are likely to result in a high risk, for example, on account of their sensitivity, where in \naccordance with the achieved state of technological knowledge a new technology is used on a large scale as well \nas to other processing operations which result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in \nparticular where those operations render it more difficult for data subjects to exercise their rights. A data \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/17 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nprotection impact assessment should also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions \nregarding specific natural persons following any systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating \nto natural persons based on profiling those data or following the processing of special categories of personal \ndata, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions and offences or related security measures. A data protection \nimpact assessment is equally required for monitoring publicly accessible areas on a large scale, especially when \nusing optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the competent supervisory authority considers \nthat the processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular \nbecause they prevent data subjects from exercising a right or using a service or a contract, or because they are \ncarried out systematically on a large scale. The processing of personal data should not be considered to be on a \nlarge scale if the processing concerns personal data from patients or clients by an individual physician, other \nhealth care professional or lawyer. In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should not be mandatory. \n(92)  \nThere are circumstances under which it may be reasonable and economical for the subject of a data protection \nimpact assessment to be broader than a single project, for example where public authorities or bodies intend to \nestablish a common application or processing platform or where several controllers plan to introduce a common \napplication or processing environment across an industry sector or segment or for a widely used horizontal \nactivity. \n(93)  \nIn the context of the adoption of the Member State law on which the performance of the tasks of the public \nauthority or public body is based and which regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in \nquestion, Member States may deem it necessary to carry out such assessment prior to the processing activities. \n(94)  \nWhere a data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing would, in the absence of safeguards, \nsecurity measures and mechanisms to mitigate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural \npersons and the controller is of the opinion that the risk cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of \navailable technologies and costs of implementation, the supervisory authority should be consulted prior to the \nstart of processing activities. Such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing and the extent and \nfrequency of processing, which may result also in a realisation of damage or interference with the rights and \nfreedoms of the natural person. The supervisory authority should respond to the request for consultation within \na specified period. However, the absence of a reaction of the supervisory authority within that period should be \nwithout prejudice to any intervention of the supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks and powers laid \ndown in this Regulation, including the power to prohibit processing operations. As part of that consultation \nprocess, the outcome of a data protection impact assessment carried out with regard to the processing at issue \nmay be submitted to the supervisory authority, in particular the measures envisaged to mitigate the risk to the \nrights and freedoms of natural persons. \n(95)  \nThe processor should assist the controller, where necessary and upon request, in ensuring compliance with the \nobligations deriving from the carrying out of data protection impact assessments and from prior consultation of \nthe supervisory authority. \n(96)  \nA consultation of the supervisory authority should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative \nor regulatory measure which provides for the processing of personal data, in order to ensure compliance of the \nintended processing with this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk involved for the data subject. \n(97)  \nWhere the processing is carried out by a public authority, except for courts or independent judicial authorities \nwhen acting in their judicial capacity, where, in the private sector, processing is carried out by a controller whose \ncore activities consist of processing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the data subjects \non a large scale, or where the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large \nscale of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal convictions and offences, a person with \nexpert knowledge of data protection law and practices should assist the controller or processor to monitor \ninternal compliance with this Regulation. In the private sector, the core activities of a controller relate to its \nprimary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities. The necessary level \nof expert knowledge should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/18 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nand the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor. Such data \nprotection officers, whether or not they are an employee of the controller, should be in a position to perform \ntheir duties and tasks in an independent manner. \n(98)  \nAssociations or other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors should be encouraged to draw \nup codes of conduct, within the limits of this Regulation, so as to facilitate the effective application of this \nRegulation, taking account of the specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors and the \nspecific needs of micro, small and medium enterprises. In particular, such codes of conduct could calibrate the \nobligations of controllers and processors, taking into account the risk likely to result from the processing for the \nrights and freedoms of natural persons. \n(99)  \nWhen drawing up a code of conduct, or when amending or extending such a code, associations and other bodies \nrepresenting categories of controllers or processors should consult relevant stakeholders, including data subjects \nwhere feasible, and have regard to submissions received and views expressed in response to such consultations. \n(100)  In order to enhance transparency and compliance with this Regulation, the establishment of certification \nmechanisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, allowing data subjects to quickly assess \nthe level of data protection of relevant products and services. \n(101)  Flows of personal data to and from countries outside the Union and international organisations are necessary for \nthe expansion of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in such flows has raised new \nchallenges and concerns with regard to the protection of personal data. However, when personal data are \ntransferred from the Union to controllers, processors or other recipients in third countries or to international \norganisations, the level of protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation should not be \nundermined, including in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country or international \norganisation to controllers, processors in the same or another third country or international organisation. In any \nevent, transfers to third countries and international organisations may only be carried out in full compliance with \nthis Regulation. A transfer could take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the \nconditions laid down in the provisions of this Regulation relating to the transfer of personal data to third \ncountries or international organisations are complied with by the controller or processor. \n(102)  This Regulation is without prejudice to international agreements concluded between the Union and third \ncountries regulating the transfer of personal data including appropriate safeguards for the data subjects. Member \nStates may conclude international agreements which involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or in\u00ad\nternational organisations, as far as such agreements do not affect this Regulation or any other provisions of \nUnion law and include an appropriate level of protection for the fundamental rights of the data subjects. \n(103)  The Commission may decide with effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector \nwithin a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate level of data protection, thus \nproviding legal certainty and uniformity throughout the Union as regards the third country or international \norganisation which is considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of personal data to \nthat third country or international organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further authoris\u00ad\nation. The Commission may also decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the \nthird country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision. \n(104)  In line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular the protection of human rights, \nthe Commission should, in its assessment of the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third \ncountry, take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access to justice as well as in\u00ad\nternational human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning \npublic security, defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The adoption of an \nadequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear \nand objective criteria, such as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and \nlegislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/19 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nprotection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are \nprocessed in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should ensure effective independent \ndata protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data \nprotection authorities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective \nadministrative and judicial redress. \n(105)  Apart from the international commitments the third country or international organisation has entered into, the \nCommission should take account of obligations arising from the third country's or international organisation's \nparticipation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal data, as \nwell as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the third country's accession to the Council of \nEurope Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing \nof Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The Commission should consult the \nBoard when assessing the level of protection in third countries or international organisations. \n(106)  The Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country, a \nterritory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, and monitor the functioning \nof decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its adequacy \ndecisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning. That periodic \nreview should be conducted in consultation with the third country or international organisation in question and \ntake into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. For the purposes \nof monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the Commission should take into consideration the views \nand findings of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources. The \nCommission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions and report any \nrelevant findings to the Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European \nParliament and of the Council (1) as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament and to the \nCouncil. \n(107)  The Commission may recognise that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an \ninternational organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently the transfer of \npersonal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited, unless the requirements in \nthis Regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules, and \nderogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for consultations between \nthe Commission and such third countries or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely \nmanner, inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it \nin order to remedy the situation. \n(108)  In the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor should take measures to compensate for the \nlack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate \nsafeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the \nCommission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses \nauthorised by a supervisory authority. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection \nrequirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the \navailability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective adminis\u00ad\ntrative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in \nparticular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data \nprotection by design and by default. Transfers may also be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public \nauthorities or bodies in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties or \nfunctions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, such as a \nmemorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by \nthe competent supervisory authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative \narrangements that are not legally binding. \n(109)  The possibility for the controller or processor to use standard data-protection clauses adopted by the \nCommission or by a supervisory authority should prevent controllers or processors neither from including the \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/20 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general \nprinciples concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, \n28.2.2011, p. 13). \nstandard data-protection clauses in a wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another \nprocessor, nor from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not contradict, directly \nor indirectly, the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission or by a supervisory authority or \nprejudice the fundamental rights or freedoms of the data subjects. Controllers and processors should be \nencouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual commitments that supplement standard protection \nclauses. \n(110)  A group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, should be able to make \nuse of approved binding corporate rules for its international transfers from the Union to organisations within the \nsame group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such \ncorporate rules include all essential principles and enforceable rights to ensure appropriate safeguards for \ntransfers or categories of transfers of personal data. \n(111)  Provisions should be made for the possibility for transfers in certain circumstances where the data subject has \ngiven his or her explicit consent, where the transfer is occasional and necessary in relation to a contract or a legal \nclaim, regardless of whether in a judicial procedure or whether in an administrative or any out-of-court \nprocedure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should also be made for the possibility for \ntransfers where important grounds of public interest laid down by Union or Member State law so require or \nwhere the transfer is made from a register established by law and intended for consultation by the public or \npersons having a legitimate interest. In the latter case, such a transfer should not involve the entirety of the \npersonal data or entire categories of the data contained in the register and, when the register is intended for \nconsultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be made only at the request of those \npersons or, if they are to be the recipients, taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the \ndata subject. \n(112)  Those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary for important reasons of \npublic interest, for example in cases of international data exchange between competition authorities, tax or \ncustoms administrations, between financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social security \nmatters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious diseases or in order to \nreduce and/or eliminate doping in sport. A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as lawful where it is \nnecessary to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another person's vital interests, \nincluding physical integrity or life, if the data subject is incapable of giving consent. In the absence of an \nadequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits \nto the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country or an international organisation. Member States \nshould notify such provisions to the Commission. Any transfer to an international humanitarian organisation of \npersonal data of a data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, with a view to \naccomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian \nlaw applicable in armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for an important reason of public interest \nor because it is in the vital interest of the data subject. \n(113)  Transfers which can be qualified as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number of data subjects, could \nalso be possible for the purposes of the compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller, when those \ninterests are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject and when the controller \nhas assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer. The controller should give particular considera\u00ad\ntion to the nature of the personal data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or \noperations, as well as the situation in the country of origin, the third country and the country of final \ndestination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect fundamental rights and freedoms of natural \npersons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in residual \ncases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific or historical research purposes or \nstatistical purposes, the legitimate expectations of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into con\u00ad\nsideration. The controller should inform the supervisory authority and the data subject about the transfer. \n(114)  In any case, where the Commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data protection in a third \ncountry, the controller or processor should make use of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and \neffective rights as regards the processing of their data in the Union once those data have been transferred so that \nthat they will continue to benefit from fundamental rights and safeguards. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/21 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(115)  Some third countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the \nprocessing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include \njudgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a \ncontroller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international \nagreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union \nor a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in \nbreach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the \nUnion by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer \nto third countries are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground \nof public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. \n(116)  When personal data moves across borders outside the Union it may put at increased risk the ability of natural \npersons to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the unlawful use or disclosure \nof that information. At the same time, supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue \ncomplaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together \nin the cross-border context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers, inconsistent \nlegal regimes, and practical obstacles like resource constraints. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer \ncooperation among data protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information and carry out \ninvestigations with their international counterparts. For the purposes of developing international cooperation \nmechanisms to facilitate and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of legislation for the \nprotection of personal data, the Commission and the supervisory authorities should exchange information and \ncooperate in activities related to the exercise of their powers with competent authorities in third countries, based \non reciprocity and in accordance with this Regulation. \n(117)  The establishment of supervisory authorities in Member States, empowered to perform their tasks and exercise \ntheir powers with complete independence, is an essential component of the protection of natural persons with \nregard to the processing of their personal data. Member States should be able to establish more than one \nsupervisory authority, to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative structure. \n(118)  The independence of supervisory authorities should not mean that the supervisory authorities cannot be subject \nto control or monitoring mechanisms regarding their financial expenditure or to judicial review. \n(119)  Where a Member State establishes several supervisory authorities, it should establish by law mechanisms for \nensuring the effective participation of those supervisory authorities in the consistency mechanism. That Member \nState should in particular designate the supervisory authority which functions as a single contact point for the \neffective participation of those authorities in the mechanism, to ensure swift and smooth cooperation with other \nsupervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission. \n(120)  Each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial and human resources, premises and \ninfrastructure necessary for the effective performance of their tasks, including those related to mutual assistance \nand cooperation with other supervisory authorities throughout the Union. Each supervisory authority should \nhave a separate, public annual budget, which may be part of the overall state or national budget. \n(121)  The general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority should be laid down by law in \neach Member State and should in particular provide that those members are to be appointed, by means of a \ntransparent procedure, either by the parliament, government or the head of State of the Member State on the \nbasis of a proposal from the government, a member of the government, the parliament or a chamber of the \nparliament, or by an independent body entrusted under Member State law. In order to ensure the independence \nof the supervisory authority, the member or members should act with integrity, refrain from any action that is \nincompatible with their duties and should not, during their term of office, engage in any incompatible \noccupation, whether gainful or not. The supervisory authority should have its own staff, chosen by the \nsupervisory authority or an independent body established by Member State law, which should be subject to the \nexclusive direction of the member or members of the supervisory authority. \n(122)  Each supervisory authority should be competent on the territory of its own Member State to exercise the powers \nand to perform the tasks conferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. This should cover in particular the \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/22 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nprocessing in the context of the activities of an establishment of the controller or processor on the territory of its \nown Member State, the processing of personal data carried out by public authorities or private bodies acting in \nthe public interest, processing affecting data subjects on its territory or processing carried out by a controller or \nprocessor not established in the Union when targeting data subjects residing on its territory. This should include \nhandling complaints lodged by a data subject, conducting investigations on the application of this Regulation and \npromoting public awareness of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal \ndata. \n(123)  The supervisory authorities should monitor the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation and \ncontribute to its consistent application throughout the Union, in order to protect natural persons in relation to \nthe processing of their personal data and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the internal market. \nFor that purpose, the supervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the Commission, \nwithout the need for any agreement between Member States on the provision of mutual assistance or on such \ncooperation. \n(124)  Where the processing of personal data takes place in the context of the activities of an establishment of a \ncontroller or a processor in the Union and the controller or processor is established in more than one \nMember State, or where processing taking place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a \ncontroller or processor in the Union substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more \nthan one Member State, the supervisory authority for the main establishment of the controller or processor or \nfor the single establishment of the controller or processor should act as lead authority. It should cooperate with \nthe other authorities concerned, because the controller or processor has an establishment on the territory of their \nMember State, because data subjects residing on their territory are substantially affected, or because a complaint \nhas been lodged with them. Also where a data subject not residing in that Member State has lodged a complaint, \nthe supervisory authority with which such complaint has been lodged should also be a supervisory authority \nconcerned. Within its tasks to issue guidelines on any question covering the application of this Regulation, the \nBoard should be able to issue guidelines in particular on the criteria to be taken into account in order to \nascertain whether the processing in question substantially affects data subjects in more than one Member State \nand on what constitutes a relevant and reasoned objection. \n(125)  The lead authority should be competent to adopt binding decisions regarding measures applying the powers \nconferred on it in accordance with this Regulation. In its capacity as lead authority, the supervisory authority \nshould closely involve and coordinate the supervisory authorities concerned in the decision-making process. \nWhere the decision is to reject the complaint by the data subject in whole or in part, that decision should be \nadopted by the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged. \n(126)  The decision should be agreed jointly by the lead supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities concerned \nand should be directed towards the main or single establishment of the controller or processor and be binding on \nthe controller and processor. The controller or processor should take the necessary measures to ensure \ncompliance with this Regulation and the implementation of the decision notified by the lead supervisory \nauthority to the main establishment of the controller or processor as regards the processing activities in the \nUnion. \n(127)  Each supervisory authority not acting as the lead supervisory authority should be competent to handle local \ncases where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State, but the subject matter of \nthe specific processing concerns only processing carried out in a single Member State and involves only data \nsubjects in that single Member State, for example, where the subject matter concerns the processing of employees' \npersonal data in the specific employment context of a Member State. In such cases, the supervisory authority \nshould inform the lead supervisory authority without delay about the matter. After being informed, the lead \nsupervisory authority should decide, whether it will handle the case pursuant to the provision on cooperation \nbetween the lead supervisory authority and other supervisory authorities concerned (\u2018one-stop-shop mechanism\u2019), \nor whether the supervisory authority which informed it should handle the case at local level. When deciding \nwhether it will handle the case, the lead supervisory authority should take into account whether there is an \nestablishment of the controller or processor in the Member State of the supervisory authority which informed it \nin order to ensure effective enforcement of a decision vis-\u00e0-vis the controller or processor. Where the lead \nsupervisory authority decides to handle the case, the supervisory authority which informed it should have the \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/23 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \npossibility to submit a draft for a decision, of which the lead supervisory authority should take utmost account \nwhen preparing its draft decision in that one-stop-shop mechanism. \n(128)  The rules on the lead supervisory authority and the one-stop-shop mechanism should not apply where the \nprocessing is carried out by public authorities or private bodies in the public interest. In such cases the only \nsupervisory authority competent to exercise the powers conferred to it in accordance with this Regulation should \nbe the supervisory authority of the Member State where the public authority or private body is established. \n(129)  In order to ensure consistent monitoring and enforcement of this Regulation throughout the Union, the \nsupervisory authorities should have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers, including powers \nof investigation, corrective powers and sanctions, and authorisation and advisory powers, in particular in cases of \ncomplaints from natural persons, and without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under \nMember State law, to bring infringements of this Regulation to the attention of the judicial authorities and \nengage in legal proceedings. Such powers should also include the power to impose a temporary or definitive \nlimitation, including a ban, on processing. Member States may specify other tasks related to the protection of \npersonal data under this Regulation. The powers of supervisory authorities should be exercised in accordance \nwith appropriate procedural safeguards set out in Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a \nreasonable time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary and proportionate in view of \nensuring compliance with this Regulation, taking into account the circumstances of each individual case, respect \nthe right of every person to be heard before any individual measure which would affect him or her adversely is \ntaken and avoid superfluous costs and excessive inconveniences for the persons concerned. Investigatory powers \nas regards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific requirements in Member State \nprocedural law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior judicial authorisation. Each legally binding measure of \nthe supervisory authority should be in writing, be clear and unambiguous, indicate the supervisory authority \nwhich has issued the measure, the date of issue of the measure, bear the signature of the head, or a member of \nthe supervisory authority authorised by him or her, give the reasons for the measure, and refer to the right of an \neffective remedy. This should not preclude additional requirements pursuant to Member State procedural law. The \nadoption of a legally binding decision implies that it may give rise to judicial review in the Member State of the \nsupervisory authority that adopted the decision. \n(130)  Where the supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged is not the lead supervisory authority, \nthe lead supervisory authority should closely cooperate with the supervisory authority with which the complaint \nhas been lodged in accordance with the provisions on cooperation and consistency laid down in this Regulation. \nIn such cases, the lead supervisory authority should, when taking measures intended to produce legal effects, \nincluding the imposition of administrative fines, take utmost account of the view of the supervisory authority \nwith which the complaint has been lodged and which should remain competent to carry out any investigation on \nthe territory of its own Member State in liaison with the competent supervisory authority. \n(131)  Where another supervisory authority should act as a lead supervisory authority for the processing activities of \nthe controller or processor but the concrete subject matter of a complaint or the possible infringement concerns \nonly processing activities of the controller or processor in the Member State where the complaint has been \nlodged or the possible infringement detected and the matter does not substantially affect or is not likely to \nsubstantially affect data subjects in other Member States, the supervisory authority receiving a complaint or \ndetecting or being informed otherwise of situations that entail possible infringements of this Regulation should \nseek an amicable settlement with the controller and, if this proves unsuccessful, exercise its full range of powers. \nThis should include: specific processing carried out in the territory of the Member State of the supervisory \nauthority or with regard to data subjects on the territory of that Member State; processing that is carried out in \nthe context of an offer of goods or services specifically aimed at data subjects in the territory of the Member \nState of the supervisory authority; or processing that has to be assessed taking into account relevant legal \nobligations under Member State law. \n(132)  Awareness-raising activities by supervisory authorities addressed to the public should include specific measures \ndirected at controllers and processors, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as natural \npersons in particular in the educational context. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/24 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(133)  The supervisory authorities should assist each other in performing their tasks and provide mutual assistance, so \nas to ensure the consistent application and enforcement of this Regulation in the internal market. A supervisory \nauthority requesting mutual assistance may adopt a provisional measure if it receives no response to a request for \nmutual assistance within one month of the receipt of that request by the other supervisory authority. \n(134)  Each supervisory authority should, where appropriate, participate in joint operations with other supervisory \nauthorities. The requested supervisory authority should be obliged to respond to the request within a specified \ntime period. \n(135)  In order to ensure the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, a consistency mechanism \nfor cooperation between the supervisory authorities should be established. That mechanism should in particular \napply where a supervisory authority intends to adopt a measure intended to produce legal effects as regards \nprocessing operations which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several Member States. It \nshould also apply where any supervisory authority concerned or the Commission requests that such matter \nshould be handled in the consistency mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures \nthat the Commission may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties. \n(136)  In applying the consistency mechanism, the Board should, within a determined period of time, issue an opinion, \nif a majority of its members so decides or if so requested by any supervisory authority concerned or the \nCommission. The Board should also be empowered to adopt legally binding decisions where there are disputes \nbetween supervisory authorities. For that purpose, it should issue, in principle by a two-thirds majority of its \nmembers, legally binding decisions in clearly specified cases where there are conflicting views among supervisory \nauthorities, in particular in the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory \nauthorities concerned on the merits of the case, in particular whether there is an infringement of this Regulation. \n(137)  There may be an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, in particular \nwhen the danger exists that the enforcement of a right of a data subject could be considerably impeded. A \nsupervisory authority should therefore be able to adopt duly justified provisional measures on its territory with a \nspecified period of validity which should not exceed three months. \n(138)  The application of such mechanism should be a condition for the lawfulness of a measure intended to produce \nlegal effects by a supervisory authority in those cases where its application is mandatory. In other cases of cross- \nborder relevance, the cooperation mechanism between the lead supervisory authority and supervisory authorities \nconcerned should be applied and mutual assistance and joint operations might be carried out between the \nsupervisory authorities concerned on a bilateral or multilateral basis without triggering the consistency \nmechanism. \n(139)  In order to promote the consistent application of this Regulation, the Board should be set up as an independent \nbody of the Union. To fulfil its objectives, the Board should have legal personality. The Board should be \nrepresented by its Chair. It should replace the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the \nProcessing of Personal Data established by Directive 95/46/EC. It should consist of the head of a supervisory \nauthority of each Member State and the European Data Protection Supervisor or their respective representatives. \nThe Commission should participate in the Board's activities without voting rights and the European Data \nProtection Supervisor should have specific voting rights. The Board should contribute to the consistent \napplication of this Regulation throughout the Union, including by advising the Commission, in particular on the \nlevel of protection in third countries or international organisations, and promoting cooperation of the \nsupervisory authorities throughout the Union. The Board should act independently when performing its tasks. \n(140)  The Board should be assisted by a secretariat provided by the European Data Protection Supervisor. The staff of \nthe European Data Protection Supervisor involved in carrying out the tasks conferred on the Board by this \nRegulation should perform its tasks exclusively under the instructions of, and report to, the Chair of the Board. \n(141)  Every data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single supervisory authority, in particular in \nthe Member State of his or her habitual residence, and the right to an effective judicial remedy in accordance \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/25 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nwith Article 47 of the Charter if the data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are \ninfringed or where the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or wholly rejects or dismisses \na complaint or does not act where such action is necessary to protect the rights of the data subject. The investi\u00ad\ngation following a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in \nthe specific case. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of \nthe complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires further investigation or coordination with another \nsupervisory authority, intermediate information should be given to the data subject. In order to facilitate the \nsubmission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such as providing a complaint \nsubmission form which can also be completed electronically, without excluding other means of communication. \n(142)  Where a data subject considers that his or her rights under this Regulation are infringed, he or she should have \nthe right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which is constituted in accordance with \nthe law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest and is active in the field of \nthe protection of personal data to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a supervisory authority, exercise \nthe right to a judicial remedy on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise the right \nto receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State may provide for such a body, organisation or \nassociation to have the right to lodge a complaint in that Member State, independently of a data subject's \nmandate, and the right to an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of a data \nsubject have been infringed as a result of the processing of personal data which infringes this Regulation. That \nbody, organisation or association may not be allowed to claim compensation on a data subject's behalf indepen\u00ad\ndently of the data subject's mandate. \n(143)  Any natural or legal person has the right to bring an action for annulment of decisions of the Board before the \nCourt of Justice under the conditions provided for in Article 263 TFEU. As addressees of such decisions, the \nsupervisory authorities concerned which wish to challenge them have to bring action within two months of \nbeing notified of them, in accordance with Article 263 TFEU. Where decisions of the Board are of direct and \nindividual concern to a controller, processor or complainant, the latter may bring an action for annulment \nagainst those decisions within two months of their publication on the website of the Board, in accordance with \nArticle 263 TFEU. Without prejudice to this right under Article 263 TFEU, each natural or legal person should \nhave an effective judicial remedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory \nauthority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision concerns in particular the exercise \nof investigative, corrective and authorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or rejection of \ncomplaints. However, the right to an effective judicial remedy does not encompass measures taken by supervisory \nauthorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions issued by or advice provided by the supervisory \nauthority. Proceedings against a supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member State \nwhere the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted in accordance with that Member State's \nprocedural law. Those courts should exercise full jurisdiction, which should include jurisdiction to examine all \nquestions of fact and law relevant to the dispute before them. \nWhere a complaint has been rejected or dismissed by a supervisory authority, the complainant may bring \nproceedings before the courts in the same Member State. In the context of judicial remedies relating to the \napplication of this Regulation, national courts which consider a decision on the question necessary to enable \nthem to give judgment, may, or in the case provided for in Article 267 TFEU, must, request the Court of Justice \nto give a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of Union law, including this Regulation. Furthermore, where a \ndecision of a supervisory authority implementing a decision of the Board is challenged before a national court \nand the validity of the decision of the Board is at issue, that national court does not have the power to declare \nthe Board's decision invalid but must refer the question of validity to the Court of Justice in accordance with \nArticle 267 TFEU as interpreted by the Court of Justice, where it considers the decision invalid. However, a \nnational court may not refer a question on the validity of the decision of the Board at the request of a natural or \nlegal person which had the opportunity to bring an action for annulment of that decision, in particular if it was \ndirectly and individually concerned by that decision, but had not done so within the period laid down in \nArticle 263 TFEU. \n(144)  Where a court seized of proceedings against a decision by a supervisory authority has reason to believe that \nproceedings concerning the same processing, such as the same subject matter as regards processing by the same \ncontroller or processor, or the same cause of action, are brought before a competent court in another \nMember State, it should contact that court in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings. If \nrelated proceedings are pending before a court in another Member State, any court other than the court first \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/26 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nseized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the \ncourt first seized if that court has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits the consoli\u00ad\ndation of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that \nit is expedient to hear and determine them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments \nresulting from separate proceedings. \n(145)  For proceedings against a controller or processor, the plaintiff should have the choice to bring the action before \nthe courts of the Member States where the controller or processor has an establishment or where the data subject \nresides, unless the controller is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers. \n(146)  The controller or processor should compensate any damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing \nthat infringes this Regulation. The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves that it is \nnot in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of \nthe case-law of the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of this Regulation. This is \nwithout prejudice to any claims for damage deriving from the violation of other rules in Union or Member State \nlaw. Processing that infringes this Regulation also includes processing that infringes delegated and implementing \nacts adopted in accordance with this Regulation and Member State law specifying rules of this Regulation. Data \nsubjects should receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have suffered. Where controllers or \nprocessors are involved in the same processing, each controller or processor should be held liable for the entire \ndamage. However, where they are joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with Member State law, \ncompensation may be apportioned according to the responsibility of each controller or processor for the damage \ncaused by the processing, provided that full and effective compensation of the data subject who suffered the \ndamage is ensured. Any controller or processor which has paid full compensation may subsequently institute \nrecourse proceedings against other controllers or processors involved in the same processing. \n(147)  Where specific rules on jurisdiction are contained in this Regulation, in particular as regards proceedings seeking \na judicial remedy including compensation, against a controller or processor, general jurisdiction rules such as \nthose of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) should not prejudice \nthe application of such specific rules. \n(148)  In order to strengthen the enforcement of the rules of this Regulation, penalties including administrative fines \nshould be imposed for any infringement of this Regulation, in addition to, or instead of appropriate measures \nimposed by the supervisory authority pursuant to this Regulation. In a case of a minor infringement or if the fine \nlikely to be imposed would constitute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand may be issued \ninstead of a fine. Due regard should however be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement, the \nintentional character of the infringement, actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered, degree of responsibility \nor any relevant previous infringements, the manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory \nauthority, compliance with measures ordered against the controller or processor, adherence to a code of conduct \nand any other aggravating or mitigating factor. The imposition of penalties including administrative fines should \nbe subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of Union law and the \nCharter, including effective judicial protection and due process. \n(149)  Member States should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements of this Regulation, \nincluding for infringements of national rules adopted pursuant to and within the limits of this Regulation. Those \ncriminal penalties may also allow for the deprivation of the profits obtained through infringements of this \nRegulation. However, the imposition of criminal penalties for infringements of such national rules and of \nadministrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem, as interpreted by the Court \nof Justice. \n(150)  In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringements of this Regulation, each \nsupervisory authority should have the power to impose administrative fines. This Regulation should indicate \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/27 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the \nrecognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (OJ L 351, 20.12.2012, p. 1). \ninfringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the related administrative fines, which should be \ndetermined by the competent supervisory authority in each individual case, taking into account all relevant \ncircumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the \ninfringement and of its consequences and the measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations under \nthis Regulation and to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the infringement. Where administrative fines are \nimposed on an undertaking, an undertaking should be understood to be an undertaking in accordance with \nArticles 101 and 102 TFEU for those purposes. Where administrative fines are imposed on persons that are not \nan undertaking, the supervisory authority should take account of the general level of income in the Member State \nas well as the economic situation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine. The \nconsistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent application of administrative fines. It should be \nfor the Member States to determine whether and to which extent public authorities should be subject to adminis\u00ad\ntrative fines. Imposing an administrative fine or giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers \nof the supervisory authorities or of other penalties under this Regulation. \n(151)  The legal systems of Denmark and Estonia do not allow for administrative fines as set out in this Regulation. The \nrules on administrative fines may be applied in such a manner that in Denmark the fine is imposed by competent \nnational courts as a criminal penalty and in Estonia the fine is imposed by the supervisory authority in the \nframework of a misdemeanour procedure, provided that such an application of the rules in those Member States \nhas an equivalent effect to administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. Therefore the competent \nnational courts should take into account the recommendation by the supervisory authority initiating the fine. In \nany event, the fines imposed should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. \n(152)  Where this Regulation does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in other cases, for \nexample in cases of serious infringements of this Regulation, Member States should implement a system which \nprovides for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. The nature of such penalties, criminal or adminis\u00ad\ntrative, should be determined by Member State law. \n(153)  Member States law should reconcile the rules governing freedom of expression and information, including \njournalistic, academic, artistic and or literary expression with the right to the protection of personal data \npursuant to this Regulation. The processing of personal data solely for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes \nof academic, artistic or literary expression should be subject to derogations or exemptions from certain \nprovisions of this Regulation if necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right \nto freedom of expression and information, as enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter. This should apply in \nparticular to the processing of personal data in the audiovisual field and in news archives and press libraries. \nTherefore, Member States should adopt legislative measures which lay down the exemptions and derogations \nnecessary for the purpose of balancing those fundamental rights. Member States should adopt such exemptions \nand derogations on general principles, the rights of the data subject, the controller and the processor, the transfer \nof personal data to third countries or international organisations, the independent supervisory authorities, \ncooperation and consistency, and specific data-processing situations. Where such exemptions or derogations \ndiffer from one Member State to another, the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject should \napply. In order to take account of the importance of the right to freedom of expression in every democratic \nsociety, it is necessary to interpret notions relating to that freedom, such as journalism, broadly. \n(154)  This Regulation allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when \napplying this Regulation. Public access to official documents may be considered to be in the public interest. \nPersonal data in documents held by a public authority or a public body should be able to be publicly disclosed \nby that authority or body if the disclosure is provided for by Union or Member State law to which the public \nauthority or public body is subject. Such laws should reconcile public access to official documents and the reuse \nof public sector information with the right to the protection of personal data and may therefore provide for the \nnecessary reconciliation with the right to the protection of personal data pursuant to this Regulation. The \nreference to public authorities and bodies should in that context include all authorities or other bodies covered \nby Member State law on public access to documents. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council (1) leaves intact and in no way affects the level of protection of natural persons with regard to the \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/28 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re\u2011use of public sector information \n(OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, p. 90). \nprocessing of personal data under the provisions of Union and Member State law, and in particular does not alter \nthe obligations and rights set out in this Regulation. In particular, that Directive should not apply to documents \nto which access is excluded or restricted by virtue of the access regimes on the grounds of protection of personal \ndata, and parts of documents accessible by virtue of those regimes which contain personal data the re-use of \nwhich has been provided for by law as being incompatible with the law concerning the protection of natural \npersons with regard to the processing of personal data. \n(155)  Member State law or collective agreements, including \u2018works agreements\u2019, may provide for specific rules on the \nprocessing of employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the conditions under which \npersonal data in the employment context may be processed on the basis of the consent of the employee, the \npurposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations \nlaid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and \ndiversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an \nindividual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the \ntermination of the employment relationship. \n(156)  The processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research \npurposes or statistical purposes should be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the \ndata subject pursuant to this Regulation. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and organisational \nmeasures are in place in order to ensure, in particular, the principle of data minimisation. The further processing \nof personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or \nstatistical purposes is to be carried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility to fulfil those purposes by \nprocessing data which do not permit or no longer permit the identification of data subjects, provided that \nappropriate safeguards exist (such as, for instance, pseudonymisation of the data). Member States should provide \nfor appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, \nscientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. Member States should be authorised to provide, \nunder specific conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for data subjects, specifications and derogations \nwith regard to the information requirements and rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction \nof processing, to data portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving purposes in the \npublic interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in \nquestion may entail specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropriate in the light \nof the purposes sought by the specific processing along with technical and organisational measures aimed at \nminimising the processing of personal data in pursuance of the proportionality and necessity principles. The \nprocessing of personal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other relevant legislation such as on \nclinical trials. \n(157)  By coupling information from registries, researchers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard to \nwidespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and depression. On the basis of registries, \nresearch results can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger population. Within social science, research on the \nbasis of registries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about the long-term correlation of a number \nof social conditions such as unemployment and education with other life conditions. Research results obtained \nthrough registries provide solid, high-quality knowledge which can provide the basis for the formulation and \nimplementation of knowledge-based policy, improve the quality of life for a number of people and improve the \nefficiency of social services. In order to facilitate scientific research, personal data can be processed for scientific \nresearch purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set out in Union or Member State law. \n(158)  Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that processing, \nbearing in mind that this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. Public authorities or public or private \nbodies that hold records of public interest should be services which, pursuant to Union or Member State law, \nhave a legal obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote, disseminate and \nprovide access to records of enduring value for general public interest. Member States should also be authorised \nto provide for the further processing of personal data for archiving purposes, for example with a view to \nproviding specific information related to the political behaviour under former totalitarian state regimes, genocide, \ncrimes against humanity, in particular the Holocaust, or war crimes. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/29 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(159)  Where personal data are processed for scientific research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that \nprocessing. For the purposes of this Regulation, the processing of personal data for scientific research purposes \nshould be interpreted in a broad manner including for example technological development and demonstration, \nfundamental research, applied research and privately funded research. In addition, it should take into account the \nUnion's objective under Article 179(1) TFEU of achieving a European Research Area. Scientific research purposes \nshould also include studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities \nof processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific conditions should apply in particular as \nregards the publication or otherwise disclosure of personal data in the context of scientific research purposes. If \nthe result of scientific research in particular in the health context gives reason for further measures in the interest \nof the data subject, the general rules of this Regulation should apply in view of those measures. \n(160)  Where personal data are processed for historical research purposes, this Regulation should also apply to that \nprocessing. This should also include historical research and research for genealogical purposes, bearing in mind \nthat this Regulation should not apply to deceased persons. \n(161)  For the purpose of consenting to the participation in scientific research activities in clinical trials, the relevant \nprovisions of Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) should apply. \n(162)  Where personal data are processed for statistical purposes, this Regulation should apply to that processing. Union \nor Member State law should, within the limits of this Regulation, determine statistical content, control of access, \nspecifications for the processing of personal data for statistical purposes and appropriate measures to safeguard \nthe rights and freedoms of the data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality. Statistical purposes mean \nany operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the \nproduction of statistical results. Those statistical results may further be used for different purposes, including a \nscientific research purpose. The statistical purpose implies that the result of processing for statistical purposes is \nnot personal data, but aggregate data, and that this result or the personal data are not used in support of \nmeasures or decisions regarding any particular natural person. \n(163)  The confidential information which the Union and national statistical authorities collect for the production of \nofficial European and official national statistics should be protected. European statistics should be developed, \nproduced and disseminated in accordance with the statistical principles as set out in Article 338(2) TFEU, while \nnational statistics should also comply with Member State law. Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European \nParliament and of the Council (2) provides further specifications on statistical confidentiality for European \nstatistics. \n(164)  As regards the powers of the supervisory authorities to obtain from the controller or processor access to \npersonal data and access to their premises, Member States may adopt by law, within the limits of this Regulation, \nspecific rules in order to safeguard the professional or other equivalent secrecy obligations, in so far as necessary \nto reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with an obligation of professional secrecy. This is without \nprejudice to existing Member State obligations to adopt rules on professional secrecy where required by Union \nlaw. \n(165)  This Regulation respects and does not prejudice the status under existing constitutional law of churches and \nreligious associations or communities in the Member States, as recognised in Article 17 TFEU. \n(166)  In order to fulfil the objectives of this Regulation, namely to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of \nnatural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data and to ensure the free movement \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/30 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products \nfor human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC (OJ L 158, 27.5.2014, p. 1). \n(2) Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing \nRegulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of data subject to statistical \nconfidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and \nCouncil Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities (OJ L 87, \n31.3.2009, p. 164). \nof personal data within the Union, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be \ndelegated to the Commission. In particular, delegated acts should be adopted in respect of criteria and \nrequirements for certification mechanisms, information to be presented by standardised icons and procedures for \nproviding such icons. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations \nduring its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing-up \ndelegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the \nEuropean Parliament and to the Council. \n(167)  In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should \nbe conferred on the Commission when provided for by this Regulation. Those powers should be exercised in \naccordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. In that context, the Commission should consider specific \nmeasures for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. \n(168)  The examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts on standard contractual \nclauses between controllers and processors and between processors; codes of conduct; technical standards and \nmechanisms for certification; the adequate level of protection afforded by a third country, a territory or a \nspecified sector within that third country, or an international organisation; standard protection clauses; formats \nand procedures for the exchange of information by electronic means between controllers, processors and \nsupervisory authorities for binding corporate rules; mutual assistance; and arrangements for the exchange of \ninformation by electronic means between supervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the \nBoard. \n(169)  The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where available evidence reveals that a \nthird country, a territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an international organisation does not \nensure an adequate level of protection, and imperative grounds of urgency so require. \n(170)  Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of natural persons and \nthe free flow of personal data throughout the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and \ncan rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt \nmeasures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union \n(TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go \nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. \n(171)  Directive 95/46/EC should be repealed by this Regulation. Processing already under way on the date of \napplication of this Regulation should be brought into conformity with this Regulation within the period of two \nyears after which this Regulation enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pursuant to Directive \n95/46/EC, it is not necessary for the data subject to give his or her consent again if the manner in which the \nconsent has been given is in line with the conditions of this Regulation, so as to allow the controller to continue \nsuch processing after the date of application of this Regulation. Commission decisions adopted and authorisations \nby supervisory authorities based on Directive 95/46/EC remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed. \n(172)  The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 28(2) of Regulation (EC) \nNo 45/2001 and delivered an opinion on 7 March 2012 (1). \n(173)  This Regulation should apply to all matters concerning the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms vis-\u00e0- \nvis the processing of personal data which are not subject to specific obligations with the same objective set out in \nDirective 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), including the obligations on the \ncontroller and the rights of natural persons. In order to clarify the relationship between this Regulation and \nDirective 2002/58/EC, that Directive should be amended accordingly. Once this Regulation is adopted, \nDirective 2002/58/EC should be reviewed in particular in order to ensure consistency with this Regulation, \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/31 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) OJ C 192, 30.6.2012, p. 7. \n(2) Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and \nthe protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, \n31.7.2002, p. 37). \nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: \nCHAPTER I \nGeneral provisions \nArticle 1 \nSubject-matter and objectives \n1.\nThis Regulation lays down rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of \npersonal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. \n2.\nThis Regulation protects fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the \nprotection of personal data. \n3.\nThe free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons \nconnected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. \nArticle 2 \nMaterial scope \n1.\nThis Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the \nprocessing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form \npart of a filing system. \n2.\nThis Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data: \n(a)  in the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law; \n(b)  by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of Chapter 2 of Title V of the TEU; \n(c)  by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity; \n(d)  by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal \noffences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to \npublic security. \n3.\nFor the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, Regulation (EC) \nNo 45/2001 applies.

personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data \nwill be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or \nstatistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and \norganisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject \n(\u2018storage limitation\u2019); \n(f)  processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against \nunauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical \nor organisational measures (\u2018integrity and confidentiality\u2019). \n2.\nThe controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018accountability\u2019). \nArticle 6 \nLawfulness of processing \n1.\nProcessing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: \n(a)  the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; \n(b)  processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps \nat the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; \n(c)  processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; \n(d)  processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; \n(e)  processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official \nauthority vested in the controller;

Any part of such a declaration which constitutes \nan infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. \n3.\nThe data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall \nnot affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject \nshall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. \n4.\nWhen assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the \nperformance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal \ndata that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. \nArticle 8 \nConditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services \n1.\nWhere point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, \nthe processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is \nbelow the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised \nby the holder of parental responsibility over the child. \nMember States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 \nyears. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/37 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n2.\nThe controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the \nholder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology. \n3.\nParagraph 1 shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation \nor effect of a contract in relation to a child. \nArticle 9 \nProcessing of special categories of personal data \n1.\nProcessing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or \ntrade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a \nnatural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be \nprohibited. \n2.\nParagraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: \n(a)  the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified \npurposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not \nbe lifted by the data subject; \n(b)  processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the \ncontroller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as \nit is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for \nappropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject; \n(c)  processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data \nsubject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; \n(d)  processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, \nassociation or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on \ncondition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who \nhave regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that \nbody without the consent of the data subjects; \n(e)  processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject; \n(f)  processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in \ntheir judicial capacity;

In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes \nconcerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to \nsuch changes. \n3.\nProcessing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, \nthat is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the \nprocessing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the \nobligations and rights of the controller. That contract or other legal act shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor: \n(a)  processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, including with regard to transfers \nof personal data to a third country or an international organisation, unless required to do so by Union or \nMember State law to which the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor shall inform the controller of that \nlegal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public \ninterest; \n(b)  ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are \nunder an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality; \n(c)  takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32; \n(d)  respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for engaging another processor; \n(e)  taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the controller by appropriate technical and organisational \nmeasures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the controller's obligation to respond to requests for \nexercising the data subject's rights laid down in Chapter III; \n(f)  assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account \nthe nature of processing and the information available to the processor; \n(g)  at the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the personal data to the controller after the end of the provision \nof services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless Union or Member State law requires storage of \nthe personal data; \n(h)  makes available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid \ndown in this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the controller or \nanother auditor mandated by the controller. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/49 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \nWith regard to point (h) of the first subparagraph, the processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in its \nopinion, an instruction infringes this Regulation or other Union or Member State data protection provisions. \n4.\nWhere a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the \ncontroller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and \nthe processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal \nact under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical \nand organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where \nthat other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the \ncontroller for the performance of that other processor's obligations. \n5.\nAdherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification \nmechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as \nreferred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article. \n6.\nWithout prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other \nlegal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual \nclauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the \ncontroller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43. \n7.\nThe Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of \nthis Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). \n8.\nA supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 \nof this Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. \n9.\nThe contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic \nform. \n10.\nWithout prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes \nand means of processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing. \nArticle 29 \nProcessing under the authority of the controller or processor \nThe processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to \npersonal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union \nor Member State law. \nArticle 30 \nRecords of processing activities \n1.\nEach controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall maintain a record of processing \nactivities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of the following information: \n(a) the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representa\u00ad\ntive and the data protection officer; \n(b)  the purposes of the processing; \n(c)  a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data; \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/50 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(d)  the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third \ncountries or international organisations;

\n4.5.2016 \nL 119/51 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(b)  the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and \nservices; \n(c)  the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or \ntechnical incident; \n(d)  a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for \nensuring the security of the processing. \n2.\nIn assessing the appropriate level of security account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by \nprocessing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to \npersonal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed. \n3.\nAdherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as \nreferred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out \nin paragraph 1 of this Article. \n4.\nThe controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the \ncontroller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the \ncontroller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. \nArticle 33 \nNotification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority \n1.\nIn the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than \n72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in \naccordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of \nnatural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be \naccompanied by reasons for the delay. \n2.\nThe processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. \n3.\nThe notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least: \n(a)  describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of \ndata subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned; \n(b)  communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more \ninformation can be obtained; \n(c)  describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; \n(d)  describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, \nincluding, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. \n4.\nWhere, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be \nprovided in phases without undue further delay. \n5.\nThe controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data \nbreach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify \ncompliance with this Article. \nArticle 34 \nCommunication of a personal data breach to the data subject \n1.\nWhen the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the \ncontroller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/52 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n2.\nThe communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain \nlanguage the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in \npoints (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3). \n3.\nThe communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following \nconditions are met: \n(a)  the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures \nwere applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal \ndata unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption; \n(b)  the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data \nsubjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise; \n(c)  it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar \nmeasure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner. \n4.\nIf the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory \nauthority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so \nor may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met. \nSection 3 \nData protection impact assessment and prior consultation \nArticle 35 \nData protection impact assessment \n1.\nWhere a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, \ncontext and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, \nthe controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing \noperations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations \nthat present similar high risks. \n2.\nThe controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data \nprotection impact assessment. \n3.\nA data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of: \n(a)  a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated \nprocessing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural \nperson or similarly significantly affect the natural person; \n(b)  processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to \ncriminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or \n(c)  a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. \n4.\nThe supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are \nsubject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority \nshall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68. \n5.\nThe supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which \nno data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board. \n6.\nPrior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall \napply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are \nrelated to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several \nMember States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/53 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n7.\nThe assessment shall contain at least: \n(a)  a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where \napplicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; \n(b)  an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; \n(c)  an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and \n(d)  the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the \nprotection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and \nlegitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. \n8.\nCompliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors \nshall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or \nprocessors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. \n9.\nWhere appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended \nprocessing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing \noperations. \n10.\nWhere processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the \nMember State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations \nin question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment \nin the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be \nnecessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities. \n11.\nWhere necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with \nthe data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations. \nArticle 36 \nPrior consultation \n1.\nThe controller shall consult the supervisory authority prior to processing where a data protection impact \nassessment under Article 35 indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken \nby the controller to mitigate the risk. \n2.\nWhere the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would \ninfringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the \nsupervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written \nadvice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. \nThat period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The \nsupervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one \nmonth of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be \nsuspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the \nconsultation. \n3.\nWhen consulting the supervisory authority pursuant to paragraph 1, the controller shall provide the supervisory \nauthority with: \n(a)  where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the controller, joint controllers and processors involved in the \nprocessing, in particular for processing within a group of undertakings; \n(b)  the purposes and means of the intended processing; \n(c)  the measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects pursuant to this \nRegulation; \n(d)  where applicable, the contact details of the data protection officer; \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/54 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(e)  the data protection impact assessment provided for in Article 35; and \n(f)  any other information requested by the supervisory authority. \n4.\nMember States shall consult the supervisory authority during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative \nmeasure to be adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on such a legislative measure, which \nrelates to processing. \n5.\nNotwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior author\u00ad\nisation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out \nby the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. \nSection 4 \nData protection off icer \nArticle 37 \nDesignation of the data protection officer \n1.\nThe controller and the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where: \n(a)  the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in their judicial capacity; \n(b)  the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their \nnature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; \nor \n(c)  the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of \ndata pursuant to Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10. \n2.\nA group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection officer is \neasily accessible from each establishment. \n3.\nWhere the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer may be \ndesignated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure and size. \n4.\nIn cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or associations and other bodies \nrepresenting categories of controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member State law shall, \ndesignate a data protection officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies \nrepresenting controllers or processors. \n5.\nThe data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert \nknowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39. \n6.\nThe data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of \na service contract. \n7.\nThe controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate \nthem to the supervisory authority. \nArticle 38 \nPosition of the data protection officer \n1.\nThe controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved, properly and in a timely \nmanner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/55 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n2.\nThe controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the tasks referred to in \nArticle 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing \noperations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge. \n3.\nThe controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions \nregarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for \nperforming his tasks. The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller \nor the processor. \n4.\nData subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their \npersonal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation. \n5.\nThe data protection officer shall be bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his or her \ntasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law. \n6.\nThe data protection officer may fulfil other tasks and duties. The controller or processor shall ensure that any such \ntasks and duties do not result in a conflict of interests. \nArticle 39 \nTasks of the data protection officer \n1.\nThe data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks: \n(a)  to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their \nobligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions; \n(b)  to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with \nthe policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of \nresponsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits; \n(c)  to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance \npursuant to Article 35; \n(d)  to cooperate with the supervisory authority; \n(e)  to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior \nconsultation referred to in Article 36, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter. \n2.\nThe data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with \nprocessing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. \nSection 5 \nCodes of conduct and certification \nArticle 40 \nCodes of conduct \n1.\nThe Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of \ncodes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific \nfeatures of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. \n2.\nAssociations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare codes of conduct, \nor amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of this Regulation, such as with regard to: \n(a)  fair and transparent processing; \n4.5.2016 \nL 119/56 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(b)  the legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific contexts; \n(c)  the collection of personal data; \n(d)  the pseudonymisation of personal data; \n(e)  the information provided to the public and to data subjects; \n(f)  the exercise of the rights of data subjects; \n(g)  the information provided to, and the protection of, children, and the manner in which the consent of the holders of \nparental responsibility over children is to be obtained; \n(h)  the measures and procedures referred to in Articles 24 and 25 and the measures to ensure security of processing \nreferred to in Article 32; \n(i)  the notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities and the communication of such personal data \nbreaches to data subjects; \n(j)  the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations; or \n(k)  out-of-court proceedings and other dispute resolution procedures for resolving disputes between controllers and data \nsubjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to the rights of data subjects pursuant to Articles 77 and 79. \n3.\nIn addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes of conduct approved \npursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be \nadhered to by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 in order to provide \nappropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations \nunder the terms referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and \nenforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards \nincluding with regard to the rights of data subjects. \n4.\nA code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body \nreferred to in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions by the controllers \nor processors which undertake to apply it, without prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities \ncompetent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. \n5.\nAssociations and other bodies referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article which intend to prepare a code of conduct \nor to amend or extend an existing code shall submit the draft code, amendment or extension to the supervisory \nauthority which is competent pursuant to Article 55.
